# This is based on where FreeBSD 12.2 expects things to be located.
# Previous FreeBSD releases have changed this over time and may
# require overrides or local configuration.
#

# FreeBSD 12 ships with an up-to-date ntpd, no need to install the
# package unless you are building one with refclock drivers enabled.
ntp::managed_package: ~

# These files moved from /var/db and /var/run, respectively, in
# FreeBSD 12 when the base system gained the ability to run
# ntpd as an unprivileged user.
#ntp::driftfile: /var/db/ntp/ntpd.drift
ntp::pidfile: /var/db/ntp/ntpd.pid

# FreeBSD 12 checks whether ntp.conf includes a driftfile command
# and disables some automatic behavior, so we don't actually want
# it defined at all.
