summary 'Configures NTP servers and clients'
description 'This module is designed to configure both NTP servers and
clients.  It has been deployed on FreeBSD (including on a stratum-1 server)
and on Ubuntu, and should support other operating systems fairly easily.
It handles package installation, service definition and configuration,
and monitoring (using monit::monitor and munin::plugin virtual resources).
All configuration is stored in Hiera.  (Note that monit and munin are
non-Forge modules and not listed as dependencies here.)'
