# Structure of ntp.keys data in hiera:
#
# ntp_keys is a hash.  The keys of the hash are tags that indicate
# what each symmetric key is to be used for: it is either the name
# of a peer or one of the special tags 'ntpq' or 'ntpdc'.  The
# value is another hash, which has the keys 'id', 'type', and 'key',
# which are the three columns of the ntp.keys file.  All of the
# keys mentioned in ntp_keys will be written to the ntp.keys file
# we construct, whether or not the server or function represented
# by the key's tag is actually in use.
#

# Yes, I could do it with Hash#inject(), but this is clearer!
